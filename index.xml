      <description>Bio I am an undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at Northwestern University. I was born in Brazil, and grew up in a small farm surrounded by the Atlantic Forest. Being curious about the world is just natural in this environment. What really made me a Physicist is the appreciation for the mathematical tools that allowed me to abstract and predict nature, organize my ideas, and make new discoveries.</description>

      <description>2023 and earlier I have worked on other exciting projects too, including research, course assignments, and personal projects. This non-exhaustive list contains some of the recent / interesting work that I have done. Note that a majority, but not all of them, are physics-related. Also note that topics are ordered first by type and then in reverse chronological order.
[Research] Measuring material losses in superconducting quantum circuits using coplanar waveguide microwave resonators During Summer and Fall of 2023, I worked on a research project in the intersection of physics and materials science.</description>
